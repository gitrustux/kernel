# RUSTICA AI CLI Implementation Checklist

---

# 1. Kernel & System Core

- [ ] Implement **RUSTUX microkernel** in Rust
  - [ ] Support architectures: `amd64`, `arm64`, `riscv64`
  - [ ] Syscall interface compatible across architectures
  - [ ] Object model with capability-based security
  - [ ] Process/thread creation, scheduling, and IPC
  - [ ] Memory management (virtual memory, paging)
  - [ ] Interrupt handling & basic drivers
- [ ] Ensure **cross-architecture consistency** for:
  - File operations
  - IPC behavior
  - Thread/process scheduling
- [ ] Implement **secure boot optional support**
  - [ ] Signed kernel verification
  - [ ] Signature verification on critical binaries

---

# 2. Installer

- [ ] Text/CLI installer (Phase 1)
  - [ ] Language/region selection
  - [ ] Disk detection & partitioning
    - [ ] EFI boot partition (FAT32, 512MB)
    - [ ] Root partition (ext4)
    - [ ] Optional home partition (ext4)
    - [ ] Optional swap partition
  - [ ] Network configuration
  - [ ] Device-type detection: desktop, laptop, mobile
  - [ ] Architecture detection: `amd64`, `arm64`, `riscv64`
  - [ ] OS profile selection: Desktop / Laptop / Mobile / Server
  - [ ] Base system installation
  - [ ] Install bootloader & configure multi-boot support
- [ ] Graphical installer (Phase 2)
  - [ ] GUI frontend for touch and non-touch devices
  - [ ] Integrate with CLI core engine

---

# 3. Filesystem

- [ ] Default root FS: `ext4`
- [ ] Mobile devices may use `F2FS` (flash-optimized)
- [ ] `/boot` partition: FAT32 (UEFI)
- [ ] Optional swap
- [ ] Map kernel object model capabilities to file permissions
- [ ] Directory structure for packages:
  ```
  /var/lib/rpg/archives/
    amd64/
    arm64/
    riscv64/
  ```
- [ ] Ensure journaling enabled for recovery

---

# 4. Package Manager (`rpg`)

- [ ] Implement CLI commands:
  - [ ] `rpg update`
  - [ ] `rpg install <package>`
  - [ ] `rpg remove <package>`
  - [ ] `rpg upgrade`
  - [ ] `rpg search <package>`
- [ ] Architecture-aware: auto-detect or allow explicit arch flag
- [ ] Package format:
  - Name
  - Version
  - Architecture
  - Capabilities/permissions
  - Digital signature
- [ ] Repository format: architecture-separated directories
- [ ] Installer integration: pre-install minimal packages per profile
- [ ] Optional Linux-style aliases (`apt`, `apt-get`)

---

# 5. Default Programs & Utilities

- [ ] Text editor:
  - [ ] GUI: `redit` (Notepad++-like, tabs, syntax highlighting)
  - [ ] CLI: `nano` or `micro` style
- [ ] Terminal emulator (GUI profiles)
- [ ] File manager (GUI profiles)
- [ ] Network utilities: ping, ip, dnslookup, ssh client
- [ ] System monitoring: CLI + GUI (lightweight)
- [ ] Archive tools: zip, tar, xz
- [ ] Boot/system logs: log viewer, crash reporter
- [ ] Utilities: calculator, screenshot tool, PDF viewer (GUI)

---

# 6. Security

- [ ] Secure boot optional support
- [ ] Signed kernel and package verification
- [ ] Capability-based access enforced by kernel
- [ ] Basic firewall / network rules (optional)
- [ ] Sandboxed apps / process isolation (future)

---

# 7. Cross-Architecture & Multi-Boot

- [ ] Build kernels per architecture
- [ ] Userland binaries per architecture
- [ ] Multi-boot support: UEFI entries, GRUB or Multiboot2
- [ ] Installer auto-selects correct profile & kernel based on architecture and device type

---

# 8. GUI: Rustica Desktop (COSMIC-inspired)

- [ ] Window server / compositor running in userspace
- [ ] IPC protocol between kernel, compositor, and GUI apps
- [ ] Desktop shell design:
  - [ ] Top bar (status, time, system indicators)
  - [ ] Dock / dash for running + pinned apps
  - [ ] App grid / launcher
  - [ ] Workspace management (virtual desktops)
  - [ ] Notifications center
  - [ ] Control center (network, audio, power, input)
  - [ ] Settings app (appearance, keyboard, default apps)
- [ ] Visual design:
  - [ ] Light & dark modes
  - [ ] Modern, clean typography
  - [ ] Subtle animations & transitions
  - [ ] Consistent iconography and layout
- [ ] Keyboard-first navigation
- [ ] Touch support for mobile devices
- [ ] GUI scaling & DPI-awareness per device

---

# 9. Optional / Future Enhancements

- [ ] Snapshots / rollback (Btrfs/ZFS)
- [ ] Sandboxed app layer (like Flatpak/Snap)
- [ ] Developer profile packages (SDK, compilers)
- [ ] Mobile optimizations (F2FS, touchscreen gestures)
- [ ] Reproducible cross-arch builds / CI pipelines
