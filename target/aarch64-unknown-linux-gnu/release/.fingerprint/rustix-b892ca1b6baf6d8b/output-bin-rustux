For enums with no data fields on any of the\nvariants, e.g. `enum Color {Red, Blue, Green}`, this effectively sets the size\nof the enum to the size of the provided type. Such an enum can be cast to a\nvalue of the same type as well. In short, `#[repr(u8)]` makes a field-less enum\nbehave like an integer with a constrained set of allowed values.\n\nFor a description of how `#[repr(C)]` and representations like `#[repr(u8)]`\naffect the layout of enums with data fields, see [RFC 2195][rfc2195].\n\nOnly field-less enums can be cast to numerical primitives. Representations like\n`#[repr(u8)]` will not apply to structs.\n\n`#[repr(packed)]` reduces padding to make the struct size smaller. The\nrepresentation of enums isn't strictly defined in Rust, and this attribute\nwon't work on enums.\n\n`#[repr(simd)]` will give a struct consisting of a homogeneous series of machine\ntypes (i.e., `u8`, `i32`, etc) a representation that permits vectorization via\nSIMD. This doesn't make much sense for enums since they don't consist of a\nsingle list of data.\n\n[rfc2195]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2195-really-tagged-unions.md\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/kernel/arch/arm64/mmu.rs","byte_start":11269,"byte_end":11396,"line_start":400,"line_end":400,"column_start":1,"column_end":128,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"static mut arm64_kernel_translation_table: [pte_t; MMU_KERNEL_PAGE_TABLE_ENTRIES_TOP] = [0; MMU_KERNEL_PAGE_TABLE_ENTRIES_TOP];","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":128}],"label":"not a struct, enum, or union","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"src/kernel/arch/arm64/mmu.rs","byte_start":11255,"byte_end":11256,"line_start":399,"line_end":399,"column_start":8,"column_end":9,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"#[repr(C, align(8))]","highlight_start":8,"highlight_end":9}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0517]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: attribute should be applied to a struct, enum, or union\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/kernel/arch/arm64/mmu.rs:399:8\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m399\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m #[repr(C, align(8))]\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m        \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m400\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m static mut arm64_kernel_translation_table: [pte_t; MMU_KERNEL_PAGE_TABLE_ENTRIES_TOP] = [0; MMU_KERNEL_PAGE_TABLE_ENTRIES_TOP];\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94mnot a struct, enum, or union\u001b[0m\n\n"}

For enums with no data fields on any of the\nvariants, e.g. `enum Color {Red, Blue, Green}`, this effectively sets the size\nof the enum to the size of the provided type. Such an enum can be cast to a\nvalue of the same type as well. In short, `#[repr(u8)]` makes a field-less enum\nbehave like an integer with a constrained set of allowed values.\n\nFor a description of how `#[repr(C)]` and representations like `#[repr(u8)]`\naffect the layout of enums with data fields, see [RFC 2195][rfc2195].\n\nOnly field-less enums can be cast to numerical primitives.
